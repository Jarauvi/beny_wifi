This repository contains Home Assistant custom component for communicating with ZJ Beny EV chargers over Wifi. 

Integration mimics ZBox phone app's communication with charger. All parameters and commands are not mapped yet, but assumption is that any charger communicating with ZBox app should work with integration.

### Supported chargers

Integration should support 1-phase and 3-phase "smart" chargers with or without DLB. Also OCPP equipped devices may work, but I've had no possibility to confirm that. If you have one and you're willing to test the compatibility, please share your results and I will add the model to supported devices üôè 

### Confirmed to work with models

| Model              | Firmware version |       Status      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| BCP-AT1N-L         | 1.26             | ‚úÖ                |
| BCP-A2-L           | 1.26             | WIP               |

### Installation

**Using HACS**
You can now find this plugin from HACS Store!

OR

Install it from repository:
- Click three dots in the upper right corner of HACS.
- From the menu, select Custom Repositories
- Paste link of this repository to Repository field
- Select "integration" to Type field
- Find and install Beny Wifi from the list of integrations
- Restart Home Assistant

**Manually**
- Copy contents of custom_components/beny_wifi folder of this repository to config/custom_components/beny_wifi folder in Home Assistant

**Configuration**
- Find Beny Wifi integration under Settings > Devices & services

### Sensors

Currently, integration creates charger device with following sensors:

* 3-phase charger only
* dlb equipped charger only

### Actions

Currently integration supports following actions:

*Only when EV is plugged to charger:*
- beny_wifi.start_charging (*device_id*)
- beny_wifi.stop_charging (*device_id*)
- beny_wifi.set_timer (*device_id | start time | end time*)
- beny_wifi.reset_timer (*device_id*)
- beny_wifi.set_maximum_session_consumption (*device_id | maximum_consumption*)

*Any state:*
- beny_wifi.request_weekly_schedule (*device_id*)
- beny_wifi.set_weekly_schedule (*device_id | sunday | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday | saturday | start time | end time)
- beny_wifi.set_maximum_monthly_consumption (*device_id | maximum_consumption*)

### Roadmap

I am pretty busy with the most adorable baby boy right now, but I'll be adding some bells and whistles when I have a moment:
- all done at the moment!

### Troubleshooting guide

   1. Get [PCAPdroid](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid)
   2. Open that up and select traffic dump to PCAP file and from target apps select Z-Box. Do not start capture yet (on my phone Z-Box did not want to connect to charger while capturing)
   3. Open Z-Box and enter the main page of device where the values and data are shown and updated
   4. Now go back to PCAPdroid and press circle with "Ready". Record a couple kb of data and stop capturing
   5. Under three dots in upper right corner, select Open PCAP file. By default, it is saved to Downloads > PCAPdroid
   6. The interesting part is UDP to port 3333
   7. From there you can check Payload tab with both request and response
   
For privacy, just keep in mind that characters 13-18 are your pin code, obfuscate it before sharing if you wish to keep it private

Tools folder has some scripts that may help:
- simple udp server that can be used for simulating charger responses
- tool for converting pcap-file to json that simulator can read
- script for translating messages
